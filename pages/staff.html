                                            A native of Champaign, Illinois, Kari has been supporting, advocating 
                                            and working to protect children for over 20 years. Kari began her professional
                                            career in Jacksonville, Illinois shortly after graduating college there, 
                                            although she started babysitting at 11 and worked in a day care center 
                                            all through college. She started as a paraprofessional, as a social worker’s
                                            assistant, providing case management to children in foster care. She then 
                                            went back to the day care where she worked in college as the Assistant 
                                            Director. Kari accepted her next role as the Program Coordinator for an 
                                            Early Intervention program serving children with disabilities. Kari was 
                                            promoted to the Director of a Day Care and remained there for 5 years. 
                                            After moving to Indiana, Kari was the program coordinator of a child and
                                            adolescent program serving children with a mental health diagnosis. Kari
                                            moved back to Champaign in 2007 and became the Child & Family Services 
                                            Manager at Champaign County Head Start where she worked for 9 years. In
                                            February of 2017 Kari became the Executive Director of the Children’s 
                                            Advocacy Center of Champaign and Ford Counties.

                                            Kari’s most important accomplishments are her two adopted children.
